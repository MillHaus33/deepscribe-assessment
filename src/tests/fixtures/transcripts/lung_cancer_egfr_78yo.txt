Doctor: Hi, thanks for coming in today. How have you been feeling since your last scan?

Patient: Mostly okay, just some shortness of breath when I walk uphill. I wanted to go over the new results.

Doctor: Sure. The CT scan confirms non-small cell lung cancer, adenocarcinoma type. You were diagnosed about six months ago, correct?

Patient: Yes, that’s right. I’m 78 years old and was diagnosed last October.

Doctor: Understood. And your biopsy showed an EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation, right?

Patient: Yes, that’s what my oncologist said. They started me on osimertinib three months ago.

Doctor: Okay, any side effects?

Patient: Mild rash and fatigue, nothing severe.

Doctor: Good. Any brain metastases or other major conditions?

Patient: No brain mets, no heart or kidney issues.

Doctor: Excellent. You live in Los Angeles, California?

Patient: Yes, LA. I’d be open to trials nearby if there are targeted therapy or combination treatment studies.

Doctor: Perfect. Let’s look for EGFR-mutated NSCLC trials for patients on or progressing after osimertinib.
