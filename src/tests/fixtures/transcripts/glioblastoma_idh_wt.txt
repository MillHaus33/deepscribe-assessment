Doctor: Thanks for coming in. I reviewed your MRI results. The lesion is consistent with recurrent glioblastoma.

Patient: I figured as much. I finished radiation and temozolomide six months ago, but my symptoms came back.

Doctor: Right. You’re 45, correct?

Patient: Yes, 45.

Doctor: The pathology report shows IDH-wildtype and MGMT unmethylated, correct?

Patient: That’s what they told me. I don’t really know what that means.

Doctor: It means the tumor might not respond well to standard chemo. Have you had any other treatments since?

Patient: Just steroids to help with swelling. No clinical trials yet.

Doctor: Okay, and you’re based in Seattle, Washington?

Patient: Yes, but I can travel within the Pacific Northwest.

Doctor: Perfect. We’ll search for glioblastoma trials accepting IDH-wildtype patients post-chemoradiation.
