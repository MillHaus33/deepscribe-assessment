Doctor: Hi, thanks for coming in. I reviewed your EMG results, and they confirm early amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Patient: That’s what my brother had. I was afraid of this.

Doctor: I know this is difficult. You’re 50, correct?

Patient: Yes. I started noticing weakness in my hands six months ago.

Doctor: Any respiratory symptoms yet?

Patient: Not yet, mostly arms and legs.

Doctor: Okay. You’re in Atlanta, Georgia?

Patient: Yes. I’d like to know about clinical trials for early ALS. I’m open to traveling.

Doctor: Perfect. I’ll search for active ALS trials, especially for genetic or early-onset cases.
