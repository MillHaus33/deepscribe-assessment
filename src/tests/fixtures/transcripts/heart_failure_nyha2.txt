Doctor: Hi, how are you feeling today?

Patient: Still getting short of breath when climbing stairs, but I can do normal activities.

Doctor: That sounds like NYHA Class II heart failure symptoms. You were diagnosed two years ago, right?

Patient: Yes. I’m 70 and was diagnosed after a hospitalization for fluid retention.

Doctor: You’re still on metoprolol, lisinopril, and furosemide?

Patient: Yes, daily. My blood pressure has been stable.

Doctor: Any recent hospital visits?

Patient: No, but I feel tired more often lately.

Doctor: Okay, and you’re living in Chicago now?

Patient: Yes, Chicago, Illinois.

Doctor: Great. I’ll look for clinical trials focusing on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction for patients your age.
