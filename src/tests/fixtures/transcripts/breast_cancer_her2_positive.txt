Doctor: Hi, I reviewed your pathology results. The biopsy confirms invasive ductal carcinoma, HER2-positive.

Patient: That’s what I was afraid of. What’s the next step?

Doctor: You’re 47, correct?

Patient: Yes. I’ve had one lumpectomy already.

Doctor: Okay. You received trastuzumab and paclitaxel for six cycles, right?

Patient: Yes, but the cancer returned in a lymph node six months later.

Doctor: Got it. No major heart problems or other chronic conditions?

Patient: No, I’m healthy otherwise.

Doctor: Great. You live in San Diego, California?

Patient: Yes. I’d consider traveling for trials targeting HER2-positive recurrence.
