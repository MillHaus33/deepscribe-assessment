Doctor: Hi, it’s been a few months since we started carbidopa-levodopa. How are your tremors?

Patient: Some improvement, but I still shake when I’m tired or stressed.

Doctor: You’re 63 and were diagnosed with Parkinson’s about a year ago, right?

Patient: Yes, that’s right.

Doctor: Any side effects from medication—nausea, dizziness?

Patient: Just mild nausea sometimes.

Doctor: Okay, and you’re still exercising three times a week?

Patient: Yes, I walk and do light yoga.

Doctor: Great. You’re based in Portland, Oregon?

Patient: Yes. I’d like to see if there are early-stage Parkinson’s studies nearby.
